     What follows is a chance conversation between John Cage and Antonin Artuad, chosen from various texts using games and a random number generator.  Over two hours the audience were ritually welcomed and invited to come and go.

Made in collaboration with and performed by Jonny Liron within a levitated set.

passions. It is not for a declaration of adulterous love that we are being prepared by the intensive training of the breath according to an ancient system.
It is for a subtle quality of scream, it is for desperate demands of the soul that we are predisposed by an admission repeated over and over again.
And we localise this breath, we divide it into states of contrac- tion and relaxation combined. We use our body as a screen through which will and the release of will pass in turn.
No sooner to we think of desiring than we forcefully project a male beat, followed with no perceptible break in continuity by a prolonged female beat.
No sooner do we think of not desiring or even of not thinking then a weary female breath makes us inhale the suffocating heat of a cave, the damp breath of a forest; and on the same prolonged beat we make a heavy exhalation; meanwhile, the muscles of our entire body, vibrating by regions, have not ceased to function.
The important thing is to become aware of these localizations
of emotional thought. One means of recognition is effort; and the
same points on which the physical effort fall are also those
touched by the emanation of emotional thought.They serve as
springboards for the emanations of feelings.
It should be noted that all that is feminine, all that is sur-
render, anguish, appeal, invocation, all that reached towards some-
thing in a gesture of supplication, rest also on the points where
effort is felt, but it does so the way

I tell what I have seen and what I believe; and whoever shall say that I have not seen what I have seen, I now tear off his head.
For I am an unpardonable Brute, and it will be thus until Time is no longer Time.
Neither Heaven nor Hell, if they exist, can do anything against this brutality which they have imposed on me, perhaps so that I may serve them . . . Who knows?
In any case, in order to lacerate me.
What exists, I see with certainty. What does not exist, I shall create, if I must.
For a long time I have felt the Void, but I have refused to throw myself into the Void.
I have been as cowardly as all that I see.
When I believed that I was denying this world, I now know that I was denying the Void.
For I know that this world does not exist and I know how it does not exist.
What I have suffered from until now is having denied the Void.
The Void which was already within me.
I know that someone wanted to enlighten me by means of the Void and that I refused to let myself be enlightened.
If I was turned into a funeral pyre, it was in order to cure me of being in the world.
And the world took everything I had.
I struggled to try to exist, to try to accept the forms (all the forms) with which the delirious illusion of being in the world has clothed reality.
I no longer want to be one of the Deluded.
Dead to the world, to what composes the world for everyone else, fallen at last, fallen, risen in this void which I was denying , I have a body which suffers the world and disgorges reality.
I have had enough of this movement of the moon which makes me summon what I deny and deny what I have summoned.
I must end it. I must break at last with this world which a Being in me, that Being which I can no longer call upon, since if it comes I will fall into the Void, which that Being has always denied.

NEW METHODS WILL BE DISCOVERED, BEARING A DEFINITE RELATION TO SCHOEN- BERG'S TWELVE-TONE SYSTEM
Schoenberg's method assigns to each material, in a group of equal materials, its function with respect to the group. (Har-
￼
mony assigned to each material, in a group of unequal materials, its func- tion with respect to the fundamental or most important material in the group.) Schoenberg's method is analogous to a society in which the empha- sis is on the group and the integration of the individual in the group.
AND PRESENT METHODS OF WRITING PERCUSSION
MUSIC
Percussion music is a contemporary transition from keyboard-influ- enced music to the all-sound music of the future. Any sound is acceptable to the composer of percussion music; he explores the academically forbidden "non-musical" field of sound insofar as is manually possible.
Methods of writing percussion music have as their goal the rhythmic structure of a composition. As soon as these methods are crystallized into one or several widely accepted methods, the means will exist for group im- provisations of unwritten but culturally important music. This has already taken place in oriental cultures and in hot jazz.
AND ANY OTHER METHODS WHICH ARE FREE FROM THE CONCEPT OF A FUNDAMENTAL TONE.
THE PRINCIPLE OF
FORM WILL BE OUR ONLY CONSTANT CONNECTION WITH THE PAST. ALTHOUGH
THE GREAT FORM OF THE FUTURE WILL NOT BE AS IT WAS IN THE PAST, AT ONE TIME THE FUGUE AND ANOTHER THE SONATA, IT WILL BE RELATED TO THESE AS THEY ARE TO EACH OTHER:
Before this happens, centers of experi- mental music must be established. In these centers, the new materials,
oscillators, turntables, generators, means for amplifying small sounds, film phonographs, etc, available for use. Composers at work using twentieth- century means for making music. Performances of results. Organization
of sound for extra-musical purposes (theatre, dance, radio, film.).
THROUGH
THE PRINCIPLE OF ORGANIZATION OR MAN'S COMMON ABILITY TO THINK
It was a Wednesday. I was in sixth grade. I overheard Dad saying to Mother, "Get ready: we're
going to New Zealand Saturday." I got ready. I read everything I could find in the school library about New Zealand. Saturday came. Nothing happened. The project was not even mentioned, that day or any succeeding day.
M.C. Richards went to see the Bolshoi Ballet. She was delighted with the dancing. She said, "It's not what they do; it's the ardour with which they do it." I said, "Yes, composition, performance, and audition or observation are really different things. They have next to nothing to do with one another." Once, I told her, I was at a house on Riverside Drive where people were invited to be present at a Zen service conducted by breath and beat for beat.
It is not enough for the spectator to be captivated by the magic of the spectacle, he will not be captivated unless we know where to reach him. We have had enough of a haphazard magic, a poetry that no longer has the support of science.
In the theatre, poetry and science must henceforth be one.
Every emotion has organic bases. It is by cultivating his emo- tion in his body that the actor recharges its voltaic density.
To know in advance the points of the body that must be touched is to throw the spectator into magical trances. And it is from this precious kind of science that poetry in the theatre has long been estranged.
To know the points of localization in the body is, therefore, to reforge the magic chain.
And with the hieroglyph of a breath I can rediscover an idea of sacred theatre.
N.B. No one knows how to scream any more in Europe, least of all, actors. In a hypnotic trance, they can no longer utter a cry.
￼
People in the theatre who can do nothing but talk and who have forgotten that they had a body have also forgotten the use of their throats. The atrophied windpipe is not even an organ but a mon- strous abstraction that talks: actors in France can no longer do anything but talk.
ORIENTAL THEATRE AND WESTERN THEATRE
The revelation of the Balinese theatre had been to provide us with a physical and non-verbal idea of theatre in which theatre is contained within the limits of everything that

Nothing has been said about Bach or Beethoven.
We are the oldest (it makes the silence) at having our air-way of knowing nowness.
Years ago I asked myself
"Why do I write music?"
An Indian musician told me the
traditional answer in India was
"To sober the mind and thus make
it susceptible to divine influences."
Same answer is given by some old
English composer. Consider this non-dualistically.

￼"He goes by me, I see him not. He passes on; but I perceive him not." These pieces take into consideration the physical action of playing an instrument.
You won't find this in the books.

What has taken the place of the mobility-immobility principle
now that I am no longer interested in it? Three coins
tossed six times yield a hexagram of which
there are sixty-four. In this way one can establish
which of sixty-four possibilities obtains. And changes.
What better technique than to leave
no traces? To determine the number of
imperfections in a given space, coins are tossed.
The number of spots is then potentially active.
Subsequent tosses determine which are actually active.
Tables are arranged referring to tempi, the number
of superimpositions, that is to say number of things
that can go on at once, sounds & silences, durations,
loudness, accents. Sounds together (suffice it to say).
Structure is of no importance,
however, I go on having it by chance
to determine first the relative probability
of the three, and then to determine which
of the three happens in the world

It doesn't seem to me to affect anything
that happens in it. I am speaking, of course,
about a time structure. It simply
allows anything to happen
in it.

QUESTION: I understand Feldman divides all pitches into high, middle, and low, and simply indicates how many in a given range are to be played, leaving the choice up to the performer.
ANSWER: Correct. That is to say, he used sometimes to do so; I haven't seen him lately. It is also essential to remember his notation of super-and subsonic vibrations (Marginal Intersection No. 1).
QUESTION: That is, there are neither divisions of the 'canvas' nor 'frame' to be observed?
ANSWER: On the contrary, you must give the closest attention to everything.
QUESTION: And timbre?
ANSWER: No wondering what's next. Going lively on "through many a perilous situation." Did you ever listen to a symphony orchestra ?
QUESTION: Dynamics?
ANSWER: These result from what actually happens (physically, me- chanically, electronically) in producing sound. You won't find it in the
books. Notate that. As far as too loud goes: "follow the general outlines of the Christian life."
QUESTION: I have asked you about the various characteristics of a sound; how, now, can you make a continuity, as I take it your intention is, without intention? Do not memory, psychology-
ANSWER: "-never again."
QUESTION: How?
ANSWER: Christian Wolff introduced space actions in his composi-
tional process at variance with the subsequently performed time actions. Earl Brown devised a composing procedure in which events, following tables of random numbers, are written out of sequence, possibly anywhere in a total time now and possibly anywhere else in the same total time next. I myself use chance operations, some derived from the I-Ching, others from the observation of imperfections in the paper upon which I happen to be writing. Your answer: by not giving it a thought.
QUESTION: Is this athematic?
ANSWER: Who said anything about themes? It is not a question of having something to say.
QUESTION: Then what is the purpose of this "experimental" music? ANSWER: No purposes. Sounds.
QUESTION: Why bother, since, as you have pointed out, sounds are
continually happening whether you produce them or not?
ANSWER: What did you say? I'm still-
QUESTION: I mean - But is this music?
ANSWER: Ah! you like sounds after all when they are made up of
vowels and consonants. You are slow-witted, for you have never brought your mind to the location of urgency. Do you need me or someone else to hold you up? Why don't you realize as I do that nothing is accomplished by writing, playing, or listening to music? Otherwise, deaf as a doornail, you will never be able to hear anything, even what's well within earshot.
QUESTION: But, seriously, if this is what music is, I could write it as well as you.
ANSWER: Have I said anything
for you can tie me up if you wish,
but there is nothing more useless than an organ.
When you will have made him a body without organs,
the you will have delivered him from all his automatic reactions
and restored him to his true freedom.
Then you will teach him again to dance wrong side out as in the frenzy of dance halls
and this wrong side out will be his real place.
￼TO FERNAND POUEY
Dear Sir,
When in discussing my "attempt"
at doing a broadcast
on the Radio,
the question of my fee "as performer" came up,
Ivry, December 11, 1947
I told you:
I place the matter in your hands,
reluctant, in an endeavor where it was a matter for me of opening
up a new path, to enter into petty discussions about money,
and into demands for more or less,
I simply thought that you would want to do the maximum on
your end
and not thinking that you have permitted that I be paid
less than any of my actors.
Despite one's attempts to be "detached,"
one must eat,
clothe oneself, get around,
that's why the sum of 3190 francs that was allotted me suffocated
me!
This said,
allow me to go back over the work that has been done.
I believe it as a mixture of the best and the worst.
I did a great deal of work in Radio before the war
with Paul Deharme
on educational programs
and the work done with your people had very little connection
with this means of expression still,
it is very important, that the director Mr. Guinard,
the technicians
and generally speaking all the people
I worked with understand
WHAT were my original intentions and desires.
Listening to it at one go, people will have the impression of a
work that is chaotic and disconnected;
a kind of random and epileptic
choppiness,
in which the wandering sensibility of the listener must also take at random
what suits him.
---------Well, THIS IS NOT SO!!
To put an end to the judgement of our actions
by destiny
and by a ruling force
is to express one's will
in a rather new way
in order to indicate that the rhythmic order of things and of the destiny of things has changed its course,
there are in the broadcast I did
enough elements that are
grating, throbbing, discordant, dissonant
so that they need only be arranged in a new order to prove that the desired end has been achieved,
my function was to provide you with elements. Have I provided them?
Some are bad,
some, I believe, are excellent,
I hope that you will find that intelligent technician
who will know how to give the elements I have provided all the
￼unusual values I was hoping for.
TO FERNARD POUEY Dear Sir,
Cordially yours, Antonin Artaud
[January 16, 1948]
Regarding
the opening section of
To Have Done with the Judgement of God
we can cut from
"to make and manufacture soldiers"
to
"In order to fight one must get shot at and although I have seen
many Americans at war."
